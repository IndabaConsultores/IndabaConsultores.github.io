                          <h3>REGISTRATION</h3>
                          <p>
                            INDABA may require a registration form to be submitted in order to access certain Content
                            and/or Services. In this case, the user must provide the information requested. In relation

                            of morality and generally accepted good customs and, in general, words and/or expressions
                            over which there is a right that excludes the use of the same by the user. To this end, the

                            names, surnames, artistic names and/or pseudonyms of third parties. If the user provides any
                            false, inaccurate or incomplete information, or if INDABA has sufficient reason to suspect
                            that such information is false, inaccurate or incomplete, or is contrary to the law or to
                            the requirements of morality and generally accepted good customs, in accordance with the
                            provisions of the previous paragraph, INDABA shall be entitled to cancel the registration

                          <p>
                            The INDABA Website may provide users with technical linking devices and directories that
                            allow them to access web pages belonging to and/or managed by third parties. The sole
                            purpose of installing these links and search directories on the Website is to make it easier
                            for users to search for and access information, content and services available on the
                            Internet.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The establishment of a link does not necessarily imply the existence of a relationship
                            between INDABA and the owner of the website on which the link is established, nor does it
                            imply acceptance and approval by INDABA of its Contents or Services.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Unless expressly stated otherwise, INDABA does not offer or market on its own behalf or
                            through third parties the information, Content and/or Services available on the linked
                            pages, nor does it control, approve or monitor them beforehand, nor does it make them its
                            own.

                          <p>
                            The user should therefore exercise extreme caution when evaluating and using the
                            information, content and services available on the linked pages. Due to the fact that INDABA
                            has no control over the pages linked to through the links incorporated in the Website, the
                            user acknowledges and accepts that INDABA assumes no responsibility whatsoever for the
                            content or services that the user may access in said pages or for any products that may be

                          <h3>VALIDITY OF THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THEIR MODIFICATION</h3>
                          <p>
                            The legal relationship deriving from access to and use of the Website, as well as the

                            established in these General Terms and Conditions in favour of third parties. INDABA may

                            rights and obligations assumed by virtue of the contractual relationship set out herein, as
                            well as the contractual position, to any third party, it being understood by means of this
                            clause that the user grants sufficient authorisation to this effect.
